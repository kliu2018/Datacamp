Your first NumPy array

# Import NumPy
import numpy as np

# Convert sudoku_list into an array
sudoku_array = np.array(sudoku_list)

# Print the type of sudoku_array 
print(type(sudoku_array))

Creating arrays from scratch

# Create an array of zeros which has four columns and two rows
zero_array = np.zeros((2, 4))
print(zero_array)

# Create an array of random floats which has six columns and three rows
random_array = np.random.random((3, 6))
print(random_array)

A range array

# Create an array of integers from one to ten
one_to_ten = np.arange(1,11)

# Create your scatterplot
plt.scatter(x=one_to_ten, y=doubling_array)
plt.show()

3D array creation
# Create the game_and_solution 3D array
game_and_solution = np.array([sudoku_game, sudoku_solution])

# Print game_and_solution
print(game_and_solution) 

The fourth dimension

# Create a second 3D array of another game and its solution 
new_game_and_solution = np.array([new_sudoku_game, new_sudoku_solution])

# Create a 4D array of both game and solution 3D arrays
games_and_solutions = np.array([game_and_solution, new_game_and_solution])

# Print the shape of your 4D array
print(games_and_solutions.shape)
